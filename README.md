# 8-BitBoothMulti-Structural

This is a VHDL class project by Jack Burgess

To run this code please download each file

Next open a VHDL GUI and input these files into the GUI

Finally simulate the design and once completed input the following inputs.

Put two signed decimal values in RegA and RegB with the limits of -128 and 127.

Next turn the low end of the CLK to 0 and the high end to 1 with a period of 10 ns.

Next put 1 into the Load Flag and click on the Play value that corresponds with the 10 ns period. 

Next turn the load flag to 0 and clock on the same play bottom

The results should now be saved into the Zreg as a hexdecimal 2s comp number.
